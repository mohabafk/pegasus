Private IP vs Public IP:
Public IP: An address used to identify a device on the internet. It's unique across the world (as 8.8.8.8).
Private IP: An address used within a local network. It's not visible on the internet (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Private IPs are reused in different networks.

IPv4 vs IPv6:
IPv4: The most common version of IP, uses 32-bit addresses (as 192.168.1.1). It can support about 4.3 billion unique addresses.
IPv6: The newer version, using 128-bit addresses (as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). It can support a huge number of unique addresses (enough for every device in the world).

TCP vs UDP:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): A connection-based protocol. It ensures data is delivered in order and without errors. Used for reliable communications (as web browsing).
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): A connectionless protocol. It sends data without ensuring delivery or order. It's faster but less reliable (like video streaming, online games).
